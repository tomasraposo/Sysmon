# Linux System Monitor

Linux system monitor application built with ncurses widget toolkit. It keeps track of CPU and memory usage and
network activity in real-time and plots it in the terminal window using different colour codes. Used C standard
library, C++ STL for a faster runtime and class templates for better code reusability. Included run-time and compile-
time checking via exception handling. Window resizing and interactive selection of network interface and tx/rx bytes
plots were also implemented.
